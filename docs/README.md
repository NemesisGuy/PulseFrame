# Project Documentation Framework

Welcome to the **PulseFrame** documentation. This framework is designed to be a comprehensive, modular, and reusable base for high-performance engineering projects.

## 🚀 Quick Start for New Projects

1. **Clone/Copy** this `docs/` folder into your project root.
2. **Review and Adjust**: Placeholders have been resolved for PulseFrame; update any project-specific details as needed.
3. **Customize**: Update each section with project-specific details while following the established architectural patterns.
4. **Iterate**: As the project evolves, keep these documents in sync with the codebase.

## 📂 Structure Overview

- **00_Overview**: High-level vision, goals, and scope.
- **01_Architecture**: The "North Star" diagram and component logic.
- **02_Backend**: API contracts, service orchestration, and data models.
- **03_Frontend**: UI design systems, state management, and component trees.
- **04_Deployment**: Docker configuration, CI/CD pipelines, and secrets management.
- **05_Operations**: Job queues, monitoring, and error handling strategies.
- **06_Configuration**: Environment-specific settings and application limits.

> [!TIP]
> Use **Mermaid.js** for any diagrams to ensure they are version-controlled and easily editable.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always verify that `Environment_Variables.md` contains only templates and **never** real production secrets.
