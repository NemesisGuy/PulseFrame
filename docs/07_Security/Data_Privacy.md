# Data Privacy

## 📋 Compliance

The system is designed with **Privacy by Design** principles, adhering to standards like GDPR, POPIA, or similar.

## 👤 User Rights

1. **Right to Access**: Users can download a full export of their data.
2. **Right to Erasure**: Deleting an account removes all personally identifiable information (PII).
3. **Right to Rectification**: Users can update their profiles at any time via the API.

## 🔐 Data Handling

- **PII Storage**: Minimal PII is collected and encrypted at rest where applicable.
- **Audit Logs**: Activity is logged for security but stripped of sensitive payload data (e.g., passwords, keys).

> Third-party integrations (e.g., Stripe, SendGrid) are audited for privacy compliance before inclusion in the project.
